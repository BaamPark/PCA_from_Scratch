# PCA implementation for face dataset

This is a Jupyter Notebook that implements PCA for face recognition using the [Olivetti Faces dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/datasets/olivetti_faces.html) provided by scikit-learn's `fetch_olivetti_faces` function. The notebook demonstrates how to use the PCA algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and visualize the results.

## Getting started

To use this notebook, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your computer. You can download Jupyter Notebook by following the instructions on the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install.html).
